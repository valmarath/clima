Clima (Weather) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It's an application that gives you the current weather conditions, such as temperature and wind velocity, of the place you typed in the input box.

## See Weather in action

- Download all files and open the [index.html](https://github.com/valmarath/clima/blob/main/index.html) file on your browser.

- To test the application, type a city of your choice and click on "buscar".

- You can also change between light and dark mode, as well as the unity that the results will appear to you.

- This application works by consuming an [API](https://openweathermap.org/current) provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

- To understand exactly how the script works and to test some of the features proposed, see the [script.js](https://github.com/valmarath/clima/blob/main/script.js).
